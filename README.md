# dotfiles
dotfiles for zsh/vim/tmux 

yes! another dotfiles repo.

Why I did this? because I used to lost a lot of time configuring and maintaining the very same configs on new machines.

The most importart feature of this repo is that you clone it and every get installed the first time you run it.
